This is my portfolio created using by [vscode-portfolio](https://github.com/itsnitinr/vscode-portfolio). GitHub Self-Hosted Runners are used to deploy this Next.js application to a server.

I've changed some functions of vscode-portfolio. And added server.js to provide a capability to host this Next.js project in Windows Server using CertBot using HTTPS. If you want to take a look at changes have been done -> [forked-repository](https://github.com/Tzesh/vscode-portfolio).
